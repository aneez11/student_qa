          "content_type": "programming",
          "language": "qbasic",
          "answer": "i) Sequential structure: This is the simplest control structure where statements are executed one after another in the order they appear in the program. There is no branching, looping, or decision-making involved. The program flows linearly from top to bottom, executing each statement in sequence until the end of the program is reached.\nii) Selection structure: Also known as decision-making or branching structure, it allows the program to choose between different paths based on conditions or criteria. If the condition is true, one set of statements is executed; if false, another set may be executed. Common constructs include IF-THEN-ELSE for simple conditions and SELECT CASE for multiple choices.\niii) Loop structure: This structure enables repetition of a block of code multiple times based on a condition or counter. It helps in performing repetitive tasks efficiently without writing the same code multiple times. Types include FOR loops (counter-controlled), WHILE loops (condition-controlled), and DO-UNTIL loops (executes until condition becomes true).",
