          "question": "Why is MS-Access called RDBMS?",
          "answer": "MS-Access is called an RDBMS because it stores data in multiple tables that are related through keys. It supports relationships between tables which allow users to connect data meaningfully. It provides tools to create, query, and manage data using SQL and graphical interfaces.",

          "id": 11,
          "question": "Differentiate between data redundancy and data inconsistency.",
          "answer": "Data redundancy means storing the same data more than once in different places, which wastes space. Data inconsistency happens when the same data has different values in different locations, causing confusion. Redundancy can lead to inconsistency if updates are not made everywhere the data appears.",
